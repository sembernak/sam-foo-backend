# Introduction
Hello! My name is Samuel Bernal and I am an aspiring software developer currently wrapping up my second year of college at the University of Delaware. I major in computer science, and as my curriculum has become more focused on practical development, I have also become more curious about what development actually looks like in the real world. What are the standards? What tools are professionals using? How much is a piece of software actually capable of? These are the questions that drove me to search for an internship this summer, and the IGN Code Foo program seems like the perfect place to fulfill my curiosity.

As for what drove me to IGN specifically, it probably comes as no surprise that IGN had a big role in my childhood through the video games that I loved to play. Looking through reviews and articles to find the next new adventure, and (sometimes embarrassingly) having to look up guides when I hit a roadblock in my journey. All the new experiences that IGN opened up to me will forever be cherished. Being able to take part in the legacy of a company as pivotal to gaming as IGN would truly be an honor, and I can’t think of a more exciting internship.

So, why should you pick me? I’ve had experience creating partially dynamic websites in a team for years through various after school clubs and programs, and more recently I’ve been delving into full blown web apps and programs through my college courses. That’s mostly the reason that I decided to go with the backend project for my application; My backend experience is probably my weakest point as a software developer. Before starting this project I had never really interacted with sql databases, establishing connections, or responding to user requests, so most of what you see here is the application of new knowledge for me. In creating this project, I applied skills of quick learning and problem solving, pulling on my previous experience with javascript, to create something with functionality and utility. That is the kind of effort you can expect from me going into this program.

Additionally, my skills as a student and worker extend beyond just coding. Teamwork has been a consistent characteristic of my time in schools and activities, so I know how to navigate a collaborative environment. I also have a good deal of experience in graphic design, clerical work, and even research. I have a lot to draw upon from my past endeavors, and I’m fully committed to bringing anything that is needed to the table this summer. 

If all this sounds like a good fit, you can be sure that you’ll have my best effort for this program.

#Hisui’s New Power Plant
1. Establish the electricity needs of Jubilife village - What is probably the first step in creating any power plant (Pokemon powered or not) is finding the demand of electricity that needs to be fulfilled. Getting this information will require a few steps:
a. Draw upon currently existing knowledge of Jubilife’s energy usage, whether it be from the library, energy companies, etc.
b. If the data from step A is not sufficient to draw conclusions, conduct a study into how much the citizens of the village need.
c. Use the data collected to find a minimum value of megawatts needed for both current and future energy needs.
2. Look into the energy generation of Voltorbs - This will also come in a few steps:
a. If a couple Voltorbs aren’t on hand, a few need to be caught for testing purposes.
b. Look into the factors that affect how much energy Voltorbs produce, such as energy collection method, what kind of food they’re given, etc. Whatever the most practical method is will be the baseline for how much energy a Voltorb will be expected to produce.
3. Catch your Voltorbs - With the energy needs of Jubilife village established, as well as how much each Voltorb produces, all that’s left to do is to catch the right number and hook them up to the grid.
